  Python workout 💪
</h1>

<p align="center">
 The best way to learn and become comfortable with a language is by practicing it frequently be it programming or human!  
 So, I have decided to improve it by coding atleast one problem everyday.
 The goal is simple: practice common data types, basic features and important core packages of python to understand it's power and usecases where it shines.
