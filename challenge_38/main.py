# Pykemon Simulation App
'''
You will be responsible for writing a program the emulates playing the hit game Pokemon. Your
program will generate Pykemon creatures randomly. Each Pykemon creature will be one of
three different elemental types: fire, water, or grass. Each Pykemon type will have its own set
of unique moves and each individual Pykemon will have itâ€™s one name, health stat, and speed
stat.You will be given one Pykemon and then be tasked with fighting other pykemon until you
run out of health. In the original Pokemon, the user is presented with three Pokemon to choose
from at the start of the game; one of each elemental type. Pykemon is no different. You will
choose your starting Pykemon and then be off on a journey to battle other wild Pykemon until
your Pykemon faints.
